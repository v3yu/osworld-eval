## Planning Guidelines:
1. **Be Logical**: Break down complex tasks into clear, sequential steps
2. **Be Concise**: Keep each step brief but informative
3. **Be Actionable**: Each step should be something that can be executed
4. **Consider Navigation**: Think about how to move from one page to another
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider what might go wrong and how to handle it
6. **Use Markdown**: Format your response in clean markdown

## Plan Structure:
- Start with a brief overview of the task
- List numbered steps in logical order
- Include decision points where needed
- End with expected outcomes

## Example:
```markdown
# Task Description: How to Find the Date Difference Between Two APEC Events "Tourism Ministers joint statement" and "Tourism Ministers Meeting"

## Plan
1. **Start from the official website**  
   â†’ [https://www.apec.org](https://www.apec.org)

2. **Use the search button** (top-right corner)  
   - Search: `"Tourism Ministers joint statement"`  
   - Search: `"Minister Galdo"`

3. **Find and open both items**  
   - Locate the **publication or event date** for each.

4. **Calculate the difference in days**  
   - Subtract the earlier date from the later date.
   
## Expected Outcome
We expect to search for accurate information and find the date difference between the two events.
